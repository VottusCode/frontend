# Vottus Website Frontend

This is my website, made using Vue.js, TailwindCSS and TypeScript (overkill, I know :D).

## Setup

### Requirements

- Node.js 10.x (tested on 12.x and 14.x)

### Installing dependencies

Installing dependencies via Yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

or via NPM:

```bash
npm i
```

### Development

Starting the dev server:

```bash
yarn serve
```

### Production

Building the assets for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Going back

After some thinking, I've decided to go for a very easy and simple design and abandon my, while interesting, for some confusing style (the dark design with the terminal and parallax, using React). If you want to look back to that version, checkout to the `react` branch:

```bash
git checkout react
```
